Exploring OECD DAC statistics after controversial G7Â summit

Since we are unable to import data from OECD DAC statistical database directly in .csv format, we've downloaded all data tables in .xlsx format and created a zip file. 
If you want to replicate the study, don't forget to export all tables and redefine the working directory.
